## Rewards change
We conducted playtest session for each of the brain individually. 
### Helpful hippos
When we playtest for the helpful hippos, we found out that each player could clearly identify the behaviors of the hippos. Once the game start, they saw the hippos began to gather around the crocodile and abuse it. No matter how many fishes are put inside the pool, most of the hippos will continuously swim around the crocodile. Hippos are afraid of being caught by the crocodile, so what they do is to help each other all the time to prevent any freezing moment of hippos being bitten by the crocodile. Even though players find this observation interesting, there is a limited amount of space for them to control and manipulate the situation.

### Selfish hippos
When we only have selfish hippos inside the scene, players find hippos indifferent from each other. 

### Balanced hippos
## Brain change
## Environment change
## Player intervention
