## Hamilton's rule
[Hamilton's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness)

In the context of sociobiology, Hamilton proposed that inclusive fitness offers a mechanism for the evolution of altruism. He claimed that this leads to natural selection to favor organisms that behave in ways that correlate with maximizing their inclusive fitness. If a gene (or gene complex) promoting altruistic behavior has copies of itself in others, helping those others survive ensures that the genes will be passed on.
Hamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population:
c<rb
where
r is the probability, above the population average, of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene â€“ commonly viewed as "degree of relatedness".
b is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior, and
c is the reproductive cost to the altruist

## Group benefits
The world is full of animals that live in groups, and they do it for a few different reasons. For one, living in groups helps some animals avoid getting eaten by predators. Some even join forces to take down prey bigger than them with less risk and effort.
