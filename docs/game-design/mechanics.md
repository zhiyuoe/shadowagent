## 2 Modes
To showcase all the design and research results, the game features Adventure mode and Sandbox mode.

### Adventure mode
Adventure mode is a goal-oriented game where players have a clear task to maximize the hippos and keep them alive before the time runs out. The game is wrapped within a simple story of rescuing hippos. To win or lose depends on if there is hippo left in the spring within 1.5 mins.

This mode has a map with clear paths formed by rocks with limited adjustment space, which encourages the player to focus on observing and reacting to the characters' behaviors. The amount of objects controlled by the players were limited to keep a balanced level of difficulty. 

### Sandbox mode
Sandbox mode is an experimental space where players can unleash their creavity to build their own map into any layouts. There are no limits of amount of objects, no win or lose conditions. This mode allows free observations in an open world setting.
