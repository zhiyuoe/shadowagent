# Lessons Learned
{: .no_toc }

Designing and developing games with reinforcement learning can be exciting and unpredictable. From our semester-long design process, we have learned a few lessons from our emerging design patterns.

## Design process with reinforcement learning<br/>

### Standard game design process<br/> 
A standard game design process looks like the image underneath that you have the uncertainty in the beginning, and you define the goals and problems clearer and clearer until the end of the production stage.<br/>

### Our design process<br/>
Due to the characteristics of unpredictability of reinforcement learning. Our projects seem something more like this, that we have the uncertainty of designing the game all the time, and along the way we pivot to a lot of different directions and try out a bunch of stuff that could work with RL.<br/>

## Game designer's toolkit 

### 1. Start with something simple and small

### 2. Don't fix the rules and game mechanics too early

### 3. Prototype the simple mechanics and document the result

### 4. Iterate and adjust the result and prototype again

You might be pivoting to a lot of different directions, and there are always uncertainty while designing, but get comfortable of staying at the uncomfortable and make good use of the unpredictable results that generate from reinforcement learning.
